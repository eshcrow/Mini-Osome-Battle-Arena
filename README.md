# Mini Osome Browser Arena

######Changbai Li


The project's goal is to create a simplified MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) experience inside the browser.

The project started as an independent study-ish learning opportunity in my 2nd year of RIT. I stopped working on it, because at that time I thought the only benefit Canvas brings to the table is that it runs on mobile platform as well, and it's not that proper to do a real time multiplayer action game on mobile platform due to the limited amount of control and network stability.

Now that Canvas technology has been more matured, and became the new Flash, and I started seeing people play Canvas based games from Google Play store on their home computer / tablet, it's time to revive this project.
